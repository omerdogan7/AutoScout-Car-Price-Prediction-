# AutoScout Project: Car Price Prediction ML Model

Welcome to the AutoScout project! This repository contains a machine learning model designed to predict car prices based on various features. The project is structured into three main parts: Data Cleaning, Handling Missing Values, and Handling Outliers. 

## Project Overview
The goal of the AutoScout project is to develop an accurate predictive model for car prices using machine learning techniques. The dataset consists of various features such as make, model, year, mileage, and other relevant attributes. 

## 1. Data Cleaning
Data cleaning is the first crucial step in preparing the dataset for analysis. This involves:
- Removing duplicates: Ensuring that each entry in the dataset is unique.
- Standardizing formats: Ensuring consistent data formats (e.g., date formats, text casing).
- Converting data types: Ensuring that numerical values are stored as integers or floats and categorical data is appropriately encoded.

## 2. Handling Missing Values
Missing values can significantly affect the performance of machine learning models. This section addresses:
- Identifying missing values: Using techniques like `isnull()` or `isna()` to find missing entries.
- Imputation strategies: Implementing methods such as mean, median, or mode imputation for numerical features and using the most frequent value for categorical features.
- Removal of entries: In cases where missing values are substantial, removing rows or columns may be necessary.

## 3. Handling Outliers
Outliers can skew the results of predictive models, making it essential to identify and handle them properly:
- Detection methods: Utilizing statistical techniques such as Z-scores or IQR (Interquartile Range) to identify outliers.
- Treatment options: Deciding whether to remove outliers, cap them at a certain threshold, or transform them using logarithmic scaling.

## Installation
To run this project locally, you'll need to have Python installed along with the required libraries. You can install the necessary packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
